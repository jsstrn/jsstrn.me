If I&amp;rsquo;m trying to assert that something should be true I avoid using the toBeTruthy() matcher.
It&amp;rsquo;s important to realize that in JavaScript, all values are truthy unless they are defined as falsy. This means that as long as result is not a falsy value (e.g. false, &amp;quot;&amp;quot;, null, undefined, NaN, etc.), the assertion will pass.
expect(result).toBeTruthy() // passes if result is {} or [] or 1 Contrast it with this approach where result will only pass if its value is true.</description></item><item><title>Backup your data with Hyper Backup on Synology NAS</title><link>https://jsstrn.me/notes/synology-backup-your-data-with-hyper-backup/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jsstrn.me/notes/synology-backup-your-data-with-hyper-backup/</guid><description>Install the Hyper Backup package in your Synology NAS and configure it to back up your data on an external cloud service such as S3, Dropbox, etc.</description></item><item><title>Buying a Raspberry Pi</title><link>https://jsstrn.me/notes/raspi-purchase/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jsstrn.me/notes/raspi-purchase/</guid><description>Tips on how to buy your first Raspberry Pi</description></item><item><title>CAP Theorem</title><link>https://jsstrn.me/notes/cap-theorem/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jsstrn.me/notes/cap-theorem/</guid><description>The CAP Theorem states that you can only provide two out of the following three guarantees:

Always consistent, but not always available One approach is when one person is working on the document, the document is locked to prevent the other person from working on it at the same time. This is the approach used in WordPress.
The trade-off here is that the document remains locked as long as one person has the document opened, making it unavailable for anyone else to work on it.</description></item><item><title>Consolidate all your cloud storage data with Cloud Sync</title><link>https://jsstrn.me/notes/synology-sync-cloud-data-with-cloud-sync/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jsstrn.me/notes/synology-sync-cloud-data-with-cloud-sync/</guid><description>It&amp;rsquo;s not uncommon to have our data stored on multiple sources on the cloud.

You can either download and install GPG Suite directly from their website or via Homebrew.</description></item><item><title>Interview tips from StashAway</title><link>https://jsstrn.me/notes/interview-tips-stashaway/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jsstrn.me/notes/interview-tips-stashaway/</guid><description>These are tips for the interview process from StashAway that are also applicable with other companies.

SSH keys SSH keys are used for authenticating with the remote Git server without you requiring to key in your username and password.
We want to associate an SSH key with your computer&amp;rsquo;s identity so generate an SSH key for each device. In the event that you lose your computer, you can revoke the SSH key and commits coming from that device will no longer be allowed.</description></item><item><title>View changes before committing</title><link>https://jsstrn.me/notes/git-commit/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jsstrn.me/notes/git-commit/</guid><description>Review code changes before staging and committing</description></item><item><title>View code changes</title><link>https://jsstrn.me/notes/git-diff/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jsstrn.me/notes/git-diff/</guid><description>View code changes with &lt;code>git diff&lt;/code></description></item><item><title>View public Telegram channels without a Telegram account</title><link>https://jsstrn.me/notes/telegram-public-channel/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jsstrn.me/notes/telegram-public-channel/</guid><description>Make any public Telegram channel viewable outside of Telegram</description></item><item><title>Watch for file changes as you run your tests</title><link>https://jsstrn.me/notes/jest-run-tests-watch/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jsstrn.me/notes/jest-run-tests-watch/</guid><description>How to run your tests as your files change in Jest</description></item><item><title>We, the Citizens</title><link>https://jsstrn.me/notes/newsletters-we-the-citizens/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jsstrn.me/notes/newsletters-we-the-citizens/</guid><description>Kirsten Han&amp;rsquo;s newsletter covering Singapore from a rights-based perspective.</description></item><item><title>What are truthy values in JavaScript?</title><link>https://jsstrn.me/notes/js-all-values-truthy/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jsstrn.me/notes/js-all-values-truthy/</guid><description>In JavaScript, all values are truthy unless they are defined as falsy. Here&amp;rsquo;s a complete list of falsy values.
Any value that isn&amp;rsquo;t falsy is by definition truthy. This means that an empty array [] or an empty object {} or a negative number are all considered truthy, but an empty string &amp;quot;&amp;quot; is falsy.
Consider the following example,
const name = &amp;#34;&amp;#34;; if (!name) { // your code here } While the code above works for checking for an empty string, the same cannot be said when checking for an empty array.</description></item><item><title>Which mechanical keyboard switch should I choose?</title><link>https://jsstrn.me/notes/mechanical-keyboards/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jsstrn.me/notes/mechanical-keyboards/</guid><description>Choosing between the different types of mechanical keyboard switches?</description></item><item><title>Which shebang to use to run Bash scripts?</title><link>https://jsstrn.me/notes/bash-shebang/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jsstrn.me/notes/bash-shebang/</guid><description>Add a shebang to the top of your Bash scripts</description></item><item><title>Why you should always use strict equality</title><link>https://jsstrn.me/notes/js-equality-table/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://jsstrn.me/notes/js-equality-table/</guid><description>JavaScript equality table</description></item></channel></rss>
