Since this project did not warrant a server to be up 24/7, I leveraged on a serverless architecture to keep the cost low. I used AWS Lambda for the lambda functions and AWS CloudWatch to trigger the lambda through scheduled events.\nFirst I built a Telegram bot which fetches a random video from the BBC Earth YouTube channel and publishes it to a Telegram channel. I then have it run on a daily schedule.\nThe BBC Earth Daily channel can be viewed from a web browser or you can subscribe to the channel on Telegram. The code is open sourced so you can fork it and build your own.\n","permalink":"https://jsstrn.github.io/jsstrn.me/projects/bbc-earth-daily/","summary":"How I built the BBC Earth Daily chatbot","title":"BBC Earth Daily"},{"content":"I created a Telegram channel to deliver dad jokes every day. I did not want to build a Node.js server and host it on Digital Ocean or Linode because that would be cost inefficient. Instead, I wanted to build an event-driven serverless architecture. We can achieve this with AWS Lambda for the lambda functions and AWS CloudWatch to trigger the lambda through scheduled events.\nFirst I created a bot and added it to a channel. The bot fetches a dad joke from icanhazdadjoke.com and publishes it to the channel. The last step was to trigger the lambda function on a regular schedule.\nYou can visit the Daily Dad Jokes public channel or subscribe to the channel on Telegram.\n","permalink":"https://jsstrn.github.io/jsstrn.me/projects/daily-dad-jokes/","summary":"How I built an event-driven serverless Telegram bot to deliver dad jokes to you daily","title":"Daily Dad Jokes"},{"content":"This is a now page.
