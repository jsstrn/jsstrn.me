Their distinction being how they are stored in memory.
Contiguous data structures are composed of a single slab of memory, and include arrays, hash tables, matrices, and heaps.
Linked data structures are composed of distinct chunks of data bound together by pointers, and include linked-lists, trees, and graphs.</description></item></channel></rss>
