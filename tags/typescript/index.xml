I do this with my notes or when I&amp;rsquo;m trying to understand something I&amp;rsquo;ve read online.
Typically, I would use the console on my browser, but that has its limitations. There are also online tools like JSFiddle, CodePen, and Replit. However, these tools tend to be geared towards frontend development with HTML and CSS, and some even require you to login just to use their service.</description></item></channel></rss>
