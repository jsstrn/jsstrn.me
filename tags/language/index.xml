He is happy She is happy I am happy You are happy Why is it that we say, &amp;ldquo;you are happy,&amp;rdquo; rather than, &amp;ldquo;you is happy,&amp;rdquo; even though &amp;lsquo;you&amp;rsquo; is singular? The answer can be found in its etymology.
In the past, we used to use the word &amp;lsquo;thou&amp;rsquo; as the second person singular form while &amp;lsquo;you&amp;rsquo; was actually the plural form used to refer to two or more people.</description></item></channel></rss>
