A simple workout means not having to dedicate half a day planning on what exercises need to be done. A short workout means no excuses not to complete them.
I found that the Push-Pull-Legs routine combined with the Rest-Pause method fits my requirements very well. Workouts are simple and take very little time to complete. Perfect for busy (or lazy) individuals.</description></item></channel></rss>
