He is happy She is happy I am happy You are happy Why is it that we say, &amp;ldquo;you are happy,&amp;rdquo; rather than, &amp;ldquo;you is happy,&amp;rdquo; even though &amp;lsquo;you&amp;rsquo; is singular? The answer can be found in its etymology.

var text = &amp;#39;outside&amp;#39; function displayText() { console.log(text) var text = &amp;#39;inside&amp;#39; } displayText() What do you think will be output onto the console?
