<p>We might be inclined to think that we can first encrypt our documents before sending them, but we soon realize that we have another problem – how do we send the password to our recipient?</p>
<p>Of course, we can&rsquo;t send the password via email. What some companies have done is to use a password that is known to the customer, like their date of birth or account number and even include the format for the password.</p>
<p>While this might seem like a good idea, information like your date of birth or passport number can all be retrieved through social engineering. Furthermore, using such weak passwords make them easy to crack in just a couple of weeks. By including the format, you&rsquo;ve just sped up this process to mere seconds.</p>
<p>Its bad enough when companies send out sensitive documents like bank statements and investment portfolios via email, but its even worse when these companies ask <em>you</em> to send them sensitive documents via email.</p>
<p>Under no circumstances should you ever do this. It does not matter if they say they are from the government, your bank, or a Nigerian Prince. An email&rsquo;s <code>sender</code> field can easily be spoofed making them appear to have originated from a legitimate source.</p>
