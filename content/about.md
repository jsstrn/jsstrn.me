Hello there! 👋 My name is Jesstern and this is my personal digital space.

![wandering mind](/images/wander.png)

## Work

I am currently exploring new opportunities.

I work on both frontend and backend web development with software testing and high test coverage. I am a proponent of test driven development and pair programming which is part of [extreme programming](/notes/agile-extreme-programming).

I was previously at [Thoughtworks](https://www.thoughtworks.com/) as a software engineer and consultant where I worked with several small and medium companies as well as large enterprises. Prior to that I developed software with various content management systems and frameworks. 🧑‍💻

## Community

I believe it's important to give back to the community. I've volunteered at the Singapore chapter of [Junior Dev](https://juniordev.io/) and SingaporeJS.

I've taught as a volunteer instructor at [Code in the Community](https://codeinthecommunity.com/), an initiative by Google and the Singaporean government, for children of disadvantaged backgrounds. 💞

## Interests

My father taught me how to play chess when I was ten years old and I've had a love for the game ever since. I play occasionally on [Lichess](https://lichess.org/@/jsstrn).

I love being in nature and the outdoors. I enjoy hiking, cycling, swimming, kayaking, and spending time at the beach with an ice cold coconut shake in hand. 🏝

When I go for long walks in the park I like to listen to podcasts and audiobooks. My all time favorite podcast is [Hidden Brain](https://hiddenbrain.org/) by Shankar Vedantam.

## This website

This website is my personal digital space.

It's built using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) with the [PaperMod](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod) theme and hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

I keep a collection of short [notes](/notes) as a reference, occasional posts on my [blog](/blog), [projects](/projects) I've built, and some simple [recipes](/recipes).

Read more about what I'm up to right [now](/now) or if you have questions, check out [FAQ](/faq).

Most of the content on this site is [searchable](/search) or you can explore [tags](/tags).

Thank you for visiting my website. Have a beautiful day! 🌤
