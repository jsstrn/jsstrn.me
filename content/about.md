Hello, my name is Jesstern. My pronouns are [they/them](https://pronoun.is/they/). I live in Singapore where I work as a software engineer. 

## Work

In the early days, I  worked as on content management systems and on frameworks like CakePHP and Ruby on Rails. 

These days I mostly work on JavaScript and TypeScript with React. On the backend, I work on Node.js with a keen interest in serverless technologies. 

I've developed bespoke digital solutions with several small and medium companies as well as large enterprises. 🧑‍💻

Besides programming, I also enjoy teaching. I've taught information technology related topics in secondary schools and software development at bootcamps. 🧑‍🏫 

## Community

I believe it's important to give back to the community. I've volunteered at the Singapore chapter of [Junior Dev](https://juniordev.io/) and SingaporeJS. 

I've taught as a volunteer instructor at [Code in the Community](https://codeinthecommunity.com/), an initiative by Google and the Singaporean government, for children of disadvantaged backgrounds. 💞

## Hobbies

I enjoy hiking, cycling, swimming, kayaking, and spending time at the beach with an ice cold coconut shake in hand. 🏝 🥥 😎

My favorite way to consume information is by listening to podcasts and audiobooks. 

## Website

This site is built with Hugo and hosted on GitHub Pages. 

I have a collection of short [notes](/notes) that I keep as a reference. You can read my [blog](/blog) where I occasionally post stuff or have a look at the [projects](/projects) I've built.

Most of the content on this site is [searchable](/search) or you can explore [tags](/tags) and [categories](/categories).
