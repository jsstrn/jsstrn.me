Hello there and welcome to my personal digital space! üëã

My name is Jesstern. I am a [neurodivergent][1], [gender nonconforming][2] software engineer based in Singapore.

## Work

I work on both frontend and backend web development. I am a proponent of test driven development and pair programming which are part of [extreme programming](/notes/agile-extreme-programming).

I have been a software engineer and technical consultant at [Thoughtworks](https://www.thoughtworks.com/) for 5 years where I work with clients to build disruptive technologies. Prior to that I worked as a freelance web developer. üßë‚Äçüíª

## Community

I believe it's important to give back to the community. I've volunteered at the Singapore chapter of [Junior Dev](https://juniordev.io/) and SingaporeJS hosting and organizing events for technical talks and workshops.

I have been a facilitator for numerous [Coderetreat](https://www.coderetreat.org/?seed=3905) events in Singapore where we focus on practicing professional software engineering approaches with test-driven development and pair programming.

I've taught as a volunteer instructor at [Code in the Community](https://codeinthecommunity.com/), an initiative by Google and the Singaporean government, for children of disadvantaged backgrounds. üíû

## Interests

My father taught me how to play chess when I was ten years old and I've had a love for the game ever since. I play occasionally on [Lichess](https://lichess.org/@/jsstrn).

I love being in nature and the outdoors. I enjoy hiking, cycling, swimming, kayaking, and spending time at the beach with an ice cold coconut shake in hand. üèù

When I go for long walks in the park I like to listen to podcasts and audiobooks. My favorite podcasts are [Hidden Brain](https://hiddenbrain.org/) by Shankar Vedantam and more recently [Game Changers](https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/gamechangers-from-the-economist/id1572322263) by The Economist.
