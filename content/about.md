Hello, my name is Jesstern. My pronouns are [they/them](https://pronoun.is/they/). I live in Singapore where I work as a software engineer. 

## Work

In the early days, I  worked on frameworks like Joomla, WordPress, CakePHP, and Ruby on Rails. These days I mostly work on JavaScript, TypeScript, and Node.js with a keen interest in serverless technologies. 🧑‍💻 

As a consultant with ThoughtWorks, I've developed bespoke digital solutions with a real estate company, and two financial institutions. 

On top of writing code for a living, I also enjoy teaching. I've taught programming and information technology related topics at Catholic High School, Nanyang Girls' High School, General Assembly, and ThoughtWorks Jumpstart. 🧑‍🏫 

## Community

I believe it's important give back to the community. I've volunteered at the Singapore chapter of [Junior Dev](https://juniordev.io/) and SingaporeJS. I've taught at [Code in the Community](https://codeinthecommunity.com/), an initiative by Google and the Singaporean government, as a volunteer instructor for children of disadvantaged backgrounds.

## Hobbies

I enjoy hiking, cycling, swimming, kayaking, and spending time at the beach with an ice cold coconut shake in hand. 🏝 🥥 😎

My favorite way to consume information is by listening to podcasts and audiobooks.
