Hello there! 👋 My name is Jesstern and this is my personal digital space.

## Work

I work on both frontend and backend web development with software testing and high test coverage. I am a proponent of test driven development and pair programming which is part of [extreme programming](/notes/agile-extreme-programming).

I was previously at [Thoughtworks](https://www.thoughtworks.com/) as a software engineer and consultant where I worked with several small and medium companies as well as large enterprises. Prior to that I developed software with various content management systems and frameworks. 🧑‍💻

## Community

I believe it's important to give back to the community. I've volunteered at the Singapore chapter of [Junior Dev](https://juniordev.io/) and SingaporeJS hosting and organizing events for technical talks and workshops.

I have been a facilitator for numerous Global Day Coderetreat events where we focus on teaching principles of test-driven development and pair programming.

I've taught as a volunteer instructor at [Code in the Community](https://codeinthecommunity.com/), an initiative by Google and the Singaporean government, for children of disadvantaged backgrounds. 💞

## Interests

My father taught me how to play chess when I was ten years old and I've had a love for the game ever since. I play occasionally on [Lichess](https://lichess.org/@/jsstrn).

I love being in nature and the outdoors. I enjoy hiking, cycling, swimming, kayaking, and spending time at the beach with an ice cold coconut shake in hand. 🏝

When I go for long walks in the park I like to listen to podcasts and audiobooks. My favorite podcasts are [Hidden Brain](https://hiddenbrain.org/) by Shankar Vedantam and more recently [Game Changers](https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/gamechangers-from-the-economist/id1572322263) by The Economist.

## Colophon

This website is built using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) with the [PaperMod](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod) theme and hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

I keep a collection of short [notes](/notes) as a reference, occasional posts on my [blog](/blog), [projects](/projects) I've built, and some simple [recipes](/recipes).
