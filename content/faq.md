## What does your name mean? 

In Sanskrit, the word ज्येष्ठ (Jyestha) means eldest. In Malayalam, one of the ways to refer to the eldest brother is ജ്യേഷ്ടന്‍ (Jyeshtan). My name, Jesstern, is derived from this origin. No points for guessing what my birth order is. 

## How do you pronounce your name?

Pretty much the way it is spelt – say, 'jess' + 'tern'. 

## What are your pronouns? 

I prefer the gender neutral pronouns [they/them](https://pronoun.is/they/).

## What are your dietary preferences? 

Whenever possible, I typically opt for non-spicy, gluten-free, caffeine-free, dairy-free, meat-free food and generally avoid alcoholic drinks.
