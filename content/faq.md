## What does your name mean? 

In Sanskrit, the word ज्येष्ठ (Jyestha) means eldest. In Malayalam, one of the ways to refer to the eldest brother is ജ്യേഷ്ടന്‍ (Jyeshtan). My name, Jesstern, is derived from this origin. No points for guessing what my birth order is. 

## How do you pronounce your name?

Pretty much the way it is spelt – say, 'jess' + 'tern'. 

## What is your ethnicity? 

I prefer to think that we are all from the same race – the human race.

 According to my genetic report, I have seven ethnicities – including Chinese (27%), Tamil (27%), and Filipino(17%). My ancestors came from Central Asia, South Asia, and Southeast Asia.

## What are your pronouns? 

I prefer the gender neutral pronouns [they/them](https://pronoun.is/they/).

## What are your dietary preferences? 

Whenever possible, I typically opt for non-spicy, gluten-free, caffeine-free, dairy-free, meat-free food and generally avoid alcoholic drinks. 

## What is your favorite color? 

I don't have a favorite color because I'm not 5 years old. 

## What gift would you like for your birthday? 

While I appreciate the thought, I generally do not like [receiving gifts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7xw-oDjwXQ). I would prefer going out for a meal instead.
