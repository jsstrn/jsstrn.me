When we were children, we might have been taught this in English grammar class:

- He is happy
- She is happy
- I am happy
- You are happy

Why is it that we say, "you _are_ happy," rather than, "you _is_ happy," even though 'you' is singular? The answer can be found in its etymology.

In the past, we used to use the word 'thou' as the second person singular form while 'you' was actually the plural form used to refer to two or more people. In modern English, we no longer have a word to distinguish between the singular and plural forms of you, instead we might say, "you all" or "you two" to refer to two or more people.

People began using the word 'you' in its singular form to refer to their superiors as a form of respect. The usage gradually gained popularity they used it amongst their peers and eventually with everyone else.
