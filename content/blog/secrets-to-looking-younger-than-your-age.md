When the founder of Telegram turned 36, he wrote about his [secrets to looking younger than his age](https://t.me/s/durov/137). 

Pavel Durov listed seven tips â€“ avoid alcohol, sleep more, avoid overeating, exercise regularly, limit stress, avoid eating meat, and live alone. 

Of these seven, I follow all of them except for living alone. I also avoid caffeine.
