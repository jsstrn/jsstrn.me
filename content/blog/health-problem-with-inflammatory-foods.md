Over 2000 years ago, Hippocrates, widely considered the father of medicine, believed that "all disease begins in the gut". It would seem he was on to something. 

In 2020, I kept a log of the food I ate and the effects its had on my digestive system. From this observation, I've been able to identify several foods that I'm sensitive to. I decided to remove gluten from my diet for a month to see the effects it would have. 

When I reintroduced gluten back into my diet, I started experiencing indigestion, bloating, belching, and diarrhea. These days, I typically observe a gluten-free vegan diet and avoid spicy food. I also avoid beverages with alcohol or caffeine. 

According to Dr Alessio Fasano, gluten is a toxin to human beings and we are unable to digest it. How we react to this toxin differs â€“ some people develop an autoimmune response that attacks its own body, others respond by attacking the gluten fragments, while others have no apparent response. While some people do not react to gluten, it is important to note that it is still a toxin. 

The problem with gluten is that it causes inflammation and results in something called leaky gut syndrome or intestinal permeability. An important task of the intestine is to form a defensive barrier to prevent absorption of damaging substances during digestion. When the permeability of the intestinal walls are compromised, harmful substances are able to leak into the blood stream. 

Chronic inflammation has been linked to many diseases, including heart disease, cancer, diabetes, autism, arthritis, depression, and Alzheimer's.
