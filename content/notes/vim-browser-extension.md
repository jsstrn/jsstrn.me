Using Vim commands allows us to reduce the number of times we need to lift our hands away from the keyboard to reach for your mouse.

While most code editors typically support Vim commands, we can't say the same for most other applications. Luckily, with browser extensions, we are able to use Vim commands in the browser.

Install the [Vim Vixen](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/vim-vixen/) browser extension to use Vim commands.

Some useful commands to remember:

Navigation

- `j`/`k` – scroll up/down on a page
- `h`/`l` – scroll left/right on a page

- `J`/`K` – go to previous/next tab
- `H`/`L` – go to previous/next page in history

- `gg`/`G` – scroll to top/bottom of a page

- `f` – reveal links on a page

Tab actions

- `r` – reload current tab
- `d` – delete current tab
- `u` – undo deleted tab
- `b` – browse opened tabs
