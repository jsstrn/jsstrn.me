I like listening to Apple Podcasts because it's available on iPhone, iPad, Mac, and Apple TV and they don't require me to sign in to them.

If you're trying to search for a particular episode or something specific then I find Apple Podcast is the way to go. Their search feature is definitely superior to most other podcast apps out there.

While I prefer Apple Podcasts, it's not the best app to discover new content. For that, I rely on [Pocket Casts](https://www.pocketcasts.com/).

I would be happy to use Pocket Casts as my default podcast app if not for the fact that they don't allow me to sign in with my Apple ID. That just adds another layer of friction.

So for now I have these two apps on my iPhone â€“ one for discovering new content and the other to actually listen to them.
