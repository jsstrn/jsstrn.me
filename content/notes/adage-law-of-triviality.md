[Law of triviality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_triviality) occurs when members of a team give disproportionate weight to trivial issues when bigger issues are up for discussion.

To illustrate this law, Parkinson came up with a fictional story of a committee who had to approve plans for a nuclear power plant. The committee, however, preferred to discuss about a bike shed instead because the problem was easier to grasp. The term bike-shedding refers to this story.
