Using an IP address can be quite cumbersome, so let's assign a `.local` domain to your NAS.

Head over to `Control Panel` and select `Network`. Under the `General` tab, set your server name. Click `Apply` and you can now access your NAS with `http://<server-name>.local:5000` from a web browser that's within the same local network.
