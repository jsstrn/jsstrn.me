While there are plenty of online whiteboards available to choose from, many of them require you to sign up for an account before you can use them. This might be suitable for collaborations with teams, but adds a layer of friction for those of us who want to use it during system design interviews. 

In particular, when you practice mock interviews on Pramp there is no built in online whiteboard so you'll have to spend precious time during the interview looking for a suitable one.

[Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/) is currently the best online whiteboard tool available. You don't need to sign up to use it and can immediately share your whiteboard with a collaborator.

One useful addition that you should do is to add the [System Design Components](https://libraries.excalidraw.com/?target=_excalidraw&referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fexcalidraw.com%2F&useHash=true&token=6MlslDbfgXpglogHz4mIe&theme=dark&sort=default#rohanp-system-design) by Rohan Pithadiya. There are many other drawing components that you can add from the their public library.

Other features include, keyboard shortcut, a light and dark theme, exporting your drawings in `.excalidraw`, `.png`, or `.svg` file formats.

Excalidraw is an [open source](https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw) software built in Reat and written in TypeScript. They also have a [Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/excalidraw/excalidraw) available so you can host your own instance under your own domain. There's even an [npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@excalidraw/excalidraw) so you can use Excalidraw as a React component in your projects.
