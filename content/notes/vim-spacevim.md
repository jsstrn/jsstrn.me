[SpaceVim](https://spacevim.org/) is a Vim distribution inspired by [spacemacs](https://www.spacemacs.org/). 

SpaceVim is *not* a GUI. After installing SpaceVim, it will alter the configuration of [Vim](https://www.vim.org/) and [Neovim](https://neovim.io/) with sensible defaults. 

This means that when you launch Vim or Neovim you will now get SpaceVim instead.
