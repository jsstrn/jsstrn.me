- Create 3 copies of your data – 1 primary and 2 backup copies
- Have 2 types of storage mediums – 
- Store 1 of these backups offsite

Let's say you have some files on your computer. You want to make a backup copy of your files on an external hard disk drive and have another copy on a cloud storage.

There are 3 copies of your data – your computer, hard disk, and cloud. You've stored your data on at least 2 storage mediums – an external disk and in the cloud. You have one backup offsite in the cloud.
