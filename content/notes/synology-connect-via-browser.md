First, check that your NAS server and your computer are on the same network. 

You can connect to your NAS server by pointing your browser to `http://<your-ip-address>:5000` and then provide the login credentials.

Check your home router to determine what IP address has been assigned to your NAS server. Optionally, you can fix an IP address so its easier for you to connect to your NAS in future. 

If you have set up a `.local` domain then point your browser to `http://<server-name>.local`.
