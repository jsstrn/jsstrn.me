## [Material UI](https://mui.com/)

Material UI is the most popular UI component library out there.

You can [theme](https://mui.com/customization/theming/) Material UI so that it doesn't look like yet another project designed with Material Design.

There's a [store](https://material-ui.com/store/) with several free and paid themes to choose from. One particularly good looking theme is [Soft UI Dashboard React](https://www.creative-tim.com/product/soft-ui-dashboard-react) by Creative Tim.

## [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/)

Chakra UI is the new kid on the block, but where it lacks in maturity it makes up for in ease of use.

If you're designing your own projects and want something that's easy to learn and doesn't look like another Material Design.
