In the Algorithm Design Manual, Skiena explains that there are two types of data structures â€“ contiguous and linked data structures. Their distinction being how they are stored in memory.

1. **Contiguous data structures** are composed of a single slab of memory, and include arrays, hash tables, matrices, and heaps.

1. **Linked data structures** are composed of distinct chunks of data bound together by *pointers*, and include linked-lists, trees, and graphs.
