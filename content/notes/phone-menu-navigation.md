Adding commas to stored telephone numbers in your contacts act as pauses which allow you to navigate complicated phone menus.

For instance, if a phone number requires that you select `1` for English then you can simply save their number as follows `+65 9876 5432,1` to your contacts. Now when you dial that number it will pause and then dial `1` for you. If you require a prolonged pause then simply add more commas, like so `+65 9876 5432,,,1`
