[RealWorld](https://github.com/lifeiscontent/realworld) is a collection of [repositories](https://codebase.show/projects/realworld) that have implemented a clone of Medium.com called Conduit in various libraries, frameworks, and programming languages. 

The idea is to go beyond yet another todo list app and give you something that's more realistic. You can also see a [live demo](https://demo.realworld.io/#/) of the application. There are separate frontend, backend, and fullstack solutions where you can explore how different implementations have structured their code. Some implementations may also have tests, though this is not required in the specifications. 

If you're just getting started with a new frontend framework, then you might want to check out the collection of [repositories](https://codebase.show/projects/todomvc) of [TodoMVC](https://todomvc.com/) instead.
