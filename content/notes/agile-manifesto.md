## Individuals and interactions over processes and tools

People over processes – while there is value in following protocols and processes, when they get in our way of our work we have to come together as a team and reevaluate what works best for us.

## Working software over comprehensive documentation

Software over specifications – remember that we cannot ship documentation to our customers. Write comprehensive unit and acceptance tests to ensure our software does what it says on the tin.

## Customer collaboration over contract negotiation

Collaboration over constraints – there's no better way to get feedback then collaborating with all stakeholders (e.g. designers, business analysts, quality analysts, product owners, and customers).

## Responding to change over following a plan

Responsiveness over rigidity – remember that the objective is not to stick to the plan, but to create value for our customers.
