These are tips for the interview process from StashAway that are also applicable with other companies.

## Do your research

Make sure you really understand what we do before you write your cover letter or hop on a call with us. We want to know that you’re making an intentional decision to apply to be a part of our team.

## Make sure your values align with ours

While technical skills are non-negotiable, we also pay a lot of attention to whether you'll be a good cultural fit for the team. We look for people who:

- Strive for excellence
- Get things done
- Communicate authentically, clearly, and effectively
- Build a positive and collaborative team
- Keep learning and improving
- Act with integrity, courage, and candour
- Maintain perspective and act accordingly

## Be clear about how you want to contribute to the team

Don’t apply for more than one role. Doing so will decrease your chances of getting hired. Be specific about what you want to do and how you want to contribute to the company.

## Be unapologetically yourself

We want to get to know you, not just what’s on your CV. Bring your passions, quirks, and ideas to the conversations you have throughout your interview process.
