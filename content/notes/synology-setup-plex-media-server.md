Plex is no longer listed as a third-party package on `Package Manager` for [DSM 7.0](https://www.synology.com/en-us/dsm/packages?) and the one that is listed for DSM 6.2 is outdated, so you have to manually install the media server.

Download [Plex media server](https://www.plex.tv/media-server-downloads/#plex-media-server) for Synology and manually install the package with `Package Manager`.

If you're on DSM 7.0 you might not be able to find Plex media server in the Package Center, you can either manually install it or try [Emby](https://www.synology.com/en-us/dsm/packages/EmbyServer?os_ver=7.0) as an alternative.

You can download content with Synology's `Download Station` and add them to the Plex directory. Use any [Plex client](https://www.plex.tv/media-server-downloads/#plex-app) to enjoy your content.
