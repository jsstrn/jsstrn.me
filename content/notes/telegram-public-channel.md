You can actually view any public Telegram channel without requiring a Telegram account. 

Typically, public channels on Telegram follow this pattern `t.me/<channel-name>`. For example, [t.me/jesstern](https://t.me/jesstern) will direct you to my public channel. However, you need to have a Telegram account to view the channel. 

Public channels on Telegram can also be viewed without a Telegram account if you include a `/s/` before the channel name. The pattern is as follows `t.me/s/<channel-name>`. For example, [t.me/s/jesstern](https://t.me/s/jesstern) can be viewed directly in your web browser.

Now you can enjoy [Daily Dad Jokes](https://t.me/s/DailyDadJokes) and [BBC Earth Daily](https://t.me/s/BBCEarthDaily) even if you don't have Telegram.
