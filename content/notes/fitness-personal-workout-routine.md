I like workouts that are uncomplicated and don't take too much time to complete. A simple workout means not having to dedicate half a day planning on what exercises need to be done. A short workout means no excuses not to complete them.

I found that the Push-Pull-Legs routine combined with the Rest-Pause method fits my requirements very well. Workouts are simple and take about 20 mins to complete. Perfect for busy (or lazy) individuals.

## Equipment

Additionally, the exercises listed here are mostly suitable for home workouts.

- Resistance bands
- Door attachment for resistance bands
- Dumbbells of various weights
- Push up grips
- Pull up bar or head to a nearby park with a pull up bar

## Workout routine

All exercise set should be completed to [form failure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training_to_failure#Types_of_failure) where additional repetitions cannot be performed without losing proper form or technique.

## Rest-Pause method

Set a target number of total reps to hit. For example, 3 sets x 10 reps = 30 total reps.

- Do as many reps as possible
- Rest for only 20 to 30 sec
- Repeat until target number reached

I use the [Interval Timer](https://apps.apple.com/sg/app/interval-timer/id1124297113) app on my phone to track my intervals.
