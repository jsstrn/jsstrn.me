I like workouts that are uncomplicated and don't take too much time to complete. A simple workout means not having to dedicate half a day planning on what exercises need to be done. A short workout means no excuses not to complete them.

I found that the Push-Pull-Legs routine combined with the Rest-Pause method fits my requirements very well. Workouts are simple and take very little time to complete. Perfect for busy (or lazy) individuals.

Additionally, the exercises listed here are mostly suitable for home workouts. The only equipment we need are resistance bands, a door attachment for bands, dumbbells, and a pull-up bar.

## Push-Pull-Legs routine

Monday (Push)
: Chest, shoulders, and triceps

Tuesday (Pull)
: Back and biceps

Wednesday (Legs)
: Lower body

Thursday (Push)
: Chest, shoulders, and triceps

Friday (Pull)
: Back and biceps

Saturday (Legs)
: Lower body

## Rest-Pause method

Set a target number of total reps to hit. For example, 3 sets x 10 reps = 30 total reps.

- Do as many reps as possible
- Rest for only 20 to 30 sec
- Repeat until target number reached

I use the [Interval Timer](https://apps.apple.com/sg/app/interval-timer/id1124297113) app on my phone to track my intervals.
