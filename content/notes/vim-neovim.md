Though Vim is open sourced, Bram Moolenaar, the creator of Vim, is the [primary contributor](https://github.com/vim/vim/graphs/contributors) to the project.

[Neovim](https://neovim.io/) solves this by refactoring the code and allowing more contributors to participate in the development of the project.

For Mac users, you can install Neovim from Homebrew,

```sh
brew install neovim
```
