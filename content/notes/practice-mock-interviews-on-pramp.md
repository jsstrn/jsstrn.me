In my opinion, the best way to practice for technical interviews is to do mock interviews with someone.

[Pramp](https://www.pramp.com/invt/6YNLBOmXn2fxX1mqK2LW) is the best platform for online mock interviews. They allow you to schedule a session with another anonymous user and you each take turns to interview each other.

Before the session, you are given a problem which will be used to ask your interviewee. You attempt to solve it on your own, but if you are stuck there are hints and a suggested solution.

Your interview partner will ask you a different problem. Once you've solved it, you switch roles and give them a problem to solve. After the session, you fill up a feedback form to give each other valuable feedback.

The community is really friendly and I've found the mock interviews and feedback incredibly helpful.
