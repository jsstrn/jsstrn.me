## Arrays

- Strings are represented by arrays which is why you can usually run array methods on strings

## Trees

- [Document Object Model](https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#introduction-to-the-dom) uses a tree structure to represent an HTML page
- Git uses a tree structure to store its commit history
- Databases like [MongoDB](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/indexes/) use B-trees for indexing
