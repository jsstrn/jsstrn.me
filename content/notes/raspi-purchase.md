The Raspberry Pi 4, 400, and Zero are all computers with varying degrees of technical specifications, while the Pico is a microcontroller, similar to the Arduino.

It comes with all the essential accessories you will need to get started including a case with a fan, some heat sinks, and a power supply. Try searching on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.sg/) for the best deals for Raspberry Pi starter kits.
