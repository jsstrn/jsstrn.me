Extreme Programming (XP) is one of many flavors of agile methodologies and in my opinion it's the best way to develop software. 

Some of the [rules](http://www.extremeprogramming.org/rules.html) of XP include [test driven development](http://www.extremeprogramming.org/rules/testfirst.html), [pair programming](http://www.extremeprogramming.org/rules/pair.html), and [continuous integration](http://www.extremeprogramming.org/rules/integrateoften.html).
