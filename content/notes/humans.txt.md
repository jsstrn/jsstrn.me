A [`humans.txt`](https://humanstxt.org/) file contains information about the different people who have contributed to building the website.

Have a look at the `humans.txt` pages by [Medium](https://medium.com/humans.txt) and [Trello](https://trello.com/humans.txt). I think Netflix has a very cool [humans.txt](https://www.netflix.com/humans.txt) page.

This website also has a [`humans.txt`](https://jsstrn.me/humans.txt) page.
